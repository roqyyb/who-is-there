## Welcome to this readme LOL

## This is a Project from javascript.info website

## How it works:

-- It asks for a login by saying "Who's there ?"
-- if login is equal "Admin," then it asks for the password.
-- if the password is equal "TheMaster," it greets and says, "Welcome."
-- else if the password is null, i.e EMPTY or ESC inputted , it alerts "Canceled."
-- else, it alerts "Wrong password!"
--else, if the input is null, it alerts "Canceled."
-- else, it alerts "I don't know you."
